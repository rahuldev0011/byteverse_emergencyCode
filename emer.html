                **HERE ARE SOME KEY POINTS ABOUT EARTHQUAKE:**

        1) Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, which creates seismic waves that travel through the earth's layers.
    
        2)This energy release is typically triggered by the movement of tectonic plates along fault lines.

       3) Predicting the exact timing and location of earthquakes remains a significant challenge, but scientists are working to improve earthquake early warning systems. 

       4) These systems can provide a few seconds to a minute of warning before the shaking arrives, allowing people to take protective actions.

       5) Poorly constructed or aging buildings are particularly vulnerable to earthquake-induced collapse, which can result in loss of life and widespread destruction.

       6) Even modern, well-constructed buildings can be severely damaged or collapse if the earthquake magnitude is high enough.

       7) Earthquakes that occur under the ocean or near coastlines can generate devastating tsunamis, which can cause massive flooding and damage along the coastlines.

       8) Tsunamis can travel at high speeds and reach great heights, posing a serious threat to coastal communities.

              ** TSUNAMIS ARE A SERIOUS NATURAL DISASTER**

    1) Tsunamis are typically generated by sudden movements of the seafloor, often caused by powerful undersea earthquakes.

    2) Other triggers include submarine landslides, volcanic eruptions, or even meteorite impacts.

    3) These events displace a large volume of water, creating a series of powerful waves.

                **PECAUTION BEFORE TSUNAMIS**

    1) Identify areas that are most vulnerable to tsunami impacts, such as low-lying coastal regions and river estuaries.

    2) Conduct detailed risk assessments to understand the potential scale, timing, and effects of a tsunami. 
    
    3) Install and maintain tsunami detection and warning systems, including seismic monitoring, buoys, and other sensors.

    4) Develop protocols for issuing timely tsunami warnings and alerts to the public.

                  **HOW TO PREPARE OURSELVES BEFORE FIRE**

     1) Place working smoke alarms on every level of your home, inside and outside bedrooms, and near cooking areas.

     2) Test smoke alarms monthly and replace batteries twice a year.

     3) Develop a fire escape plan that includes two ways out of every room and a meeting place outside.

     4) Practice your home fire drill with everyone in your household at least twice a year.

    5) Ensure all doors and windows leading outside open easily and are free of clutter.

    6) Make sure your house number is clearly visible from the street.
                
                **WHATS STEPS SHOULD WE HAVE TO FOLLOW AFTER FIRE**

     1) Get everyone out of the home immediately and call the fire department if they have not already been notified.

     2) Perform a head count to make sure all family members and pets have evacuated safely.  
     
     3) Do not re-enter the home until the fire department has given the all-clear.

     4) Dial 911 or the local emergency number to report the fire and request immediate assistance.

                         **HOW TO PERPARE YOURSELF BEFORE FLOOD**

     1) Understand if your home or community is located in a flood-prone area.

     2) Stay informed about weather forecasts and any flood watches/warnings in your region.  
     
     3) Clear rain gutters and downspouts to allow water to flow away from your home.

     4) Install backflow valves or plugs to prevent floodwater from entering your home through drains and toilets.
     
     5) Elevate your furnace, water heater, and electrical panel if your home is prone to flooding.

     6) Consider installing flood-resistant doors, windows, and walls.

                    **WHAT TO DO AFTER FLLOD**

     1) Wait until authorities indicate it is safe to return to your home and inspect the premises.

     2) Look for structural damage, electrical issues, and any standing water.

     3) Document the damage with photos and videos for insurance purposes.

     4) Be cautious of electrical and gas hazards, and shut off utilities if necessary.
